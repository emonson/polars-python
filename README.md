# polars-python

*Except for the workshop materials listed below, 
right now this is mostly a work-in-progress repository. 
Many of the notebooks are old Pandas code that's been
translated into Polars code cells as a test, 
but they have not been properly documented for Polars
(meaning much of the markdown is still for the old Pandas content).*
